How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    You can see the typos.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

   Yes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro - you only save when you know you want to, so you can think about the files.
Con - you might forget to save

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    I dont use Google Docs so I dont know the difference but in general if you upload a package of related files its good to do them all at once.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

   we didnt go over this yet so how would I know, I'm new here.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can undo what you did

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    This class would be a good start!
